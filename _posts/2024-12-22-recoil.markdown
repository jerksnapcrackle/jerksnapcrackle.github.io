Since [trigger of my weapons can be pressed](https://x.com/jerksnapcrackle/status/1868614703200739632), it is necessary to enhance the physical feedback. 

In this article, I will try to add recoil to the Douser Dualies FF(ガエンFF).

I choose Douser Dualies FF because I like its shooting sound.

## Components

+ NE555L-D08-T

## Circuit

The basic idea of reproduce recoil is using a 555 timer to trigger the Push-Pull Solenoid.
