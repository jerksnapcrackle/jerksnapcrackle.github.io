A cool-looking Grizzco Blaster can be divided into three parts:
1. **glowing pill case** : the four yellow/orange tube cases on the top of the weapon
2. **water spray mechanism** : ultimately, it's a water gun :thinking_face:
3. **shell** : of cause, it should look like the _Grizzco Blaster_ in appearance

In the following three sections, I will describe these parts in detail.
